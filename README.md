# HR-Star-Charts
I continue to use data science to analyze astronomical datasets. Also a beginner's project, where I take a dataset from Kaggle and use it to create an HR (Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram) star chart.

For those of you less familiar with the astronomical world, HR star charts are scatterplots used to display the relationship between a star's absolute magnitude/luminosity and temperatures. One may use this to chart the life cycle of a star.
